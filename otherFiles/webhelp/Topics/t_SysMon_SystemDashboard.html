  <div class="body">
    <p class="p">The
        <span class="keyword wintitle">System Dashboard</span> provides general information as well as information
      related to the JVM and the host system of the currently selected VersaLex. The
        <span class="keyword wintitle">System Dashboard</span> is displayed.</p>

    
    <div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">General Information Table</h2>
      
      
      <p class="p">The <span class="keyword wintitle">General Information</span> table provides information identifying the
        product, serial number, alias, version, version available, pool name, IP address, and
        date/time the application was last started.</p>

      <p class="p">There are no sub-reports from this library component.</p>

    </div>

    <div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">CPU Usage Percentage Chart</h2>
      
      
      <p class="p">The <span class="keyword wintitle">CPU Usage Percentage</span> chart displays the current CPU load as a
        percentage of total CPU capacity related to the VersaLex server.</p>

      <p class="p">A continuously high CPU load can indicate that another VersaLex should be added to the
        system to spread out the load.</p>

      <p class="p">Access the <span class="keyword wintitle">CPU History</span> sub-report by clicking on the needle in the
        graph.</p>

    </div>

    <div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">CPU History Report</h2>
      
      
      <p class="p">The <span class="keyword wintitle">CPU History</span> report displays the CPU load as a percentage of total
        CPU capacity over time. By default, it will show the last 60 minutes of history. Change the
          <span class="ph uicontrol">Start date/time</span> of the chart and the number of
          <span class="ph uicontrol">Minutes</span> displayed using the parameter control box. Use the zoom
        slider at the bottom to zoom in closer to a specific time. Hovering the cursor over a
        specific data point on the chart will display information about that data point.</p>

    </div>

    <div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">System Uptime Percentage Chart</h2>
      
      
      <p class="p">The <span class="keyword wintitle">System Uptime Percentage</span> chart provides the percentage of time
        VersaLex has been running. It measures the availability of VersaLex and its installed
        components.</p>

      <p class="p">There are no sub-reports from this library component.</p>

    </div>

    <div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Heap Memory Chart</h2>
      
      
      <p class="p">The <span class="keyword wintitle">Heap Memory</span> chart displays the percentage of heap memory used.
        Heap memory is the portion of memory in which dynamically allocated memory resides. Memory
        allocated from the heap will remain allocated until either the memory is freed up or the
        program terminates. If all references to allocated memory are lost you have a memory leak:
        the memory has still been allocated, but there is no easy way of accessing it anymore.
        Leaked memory cannot be reclaimed for future memory allocations, but when the program ends
        the memory will be freed up by the operating system.</p>

      <p class="p">The maximum heap memory can automatically be determined by the JVM, or it can be configured
        as a specific maximum. If the system runs out of heap memory, it could be a memory leak as
        mentioned above, but it could also be that the maximum value is set too low for the amount
        of VersaLex traffic. If the maximum is already set high and VersaLex is still running near
        the maximum, that indicates that another VersaLex should be added to the system so the load
        can be spread out between more VersaLexes.</p>

      <p class="p">Access the <span class="keyword wintitle">Heap Memory History</span> sub-report by clicking on the bar.</p>

    </div>

    <div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Heap Memory History Report</h2>
      
      
      <p class="p">The <span class="keyword wintitle">Heap Memory History</span> report displays the heap memory usage over
        time. By default, it will show the last 60 minutes of history. Change the <span class="ph uicontrol">Start
          date/time</span> of the chart and the number of <span class="ph uicontrol">Minutes</span>
        displayed using the parameter control box. Use the zoom slider at the bottom to zoom in
        closer to a specific time. Hovering the cursor over a specific data point on the chart will
        display information about that data point.</p>

    </div>

    <div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Perm Gen Memory Chart</h2>
      
      
      <p class="p">The <span class="keyword wintitle">Perm Gen Memory</span> chart displays the percentage of perm gen memory
        used.</p>

      <p class="p">Perm Gen Memory is a heap in the JVM dedicated to storing the JVM's internal representation
        of Java Classes and interned String instances. In the Oracle JVM, the heap is a fixed size.
        If an attempt is made to load more class instances than will fit in this area, an
          <span class="ph uicontrol">Out Of Memory Error</span> occurs, even when there is still plenty of
        space on the other heaps.</p>

      <p class="p">A problem in the Perm Gen Memory area will typically show a configuration problem. For
        instance, if JMS URI is being used, the classes of the specific JMS provider are also loaded
        into the VersaLex JVM. This can be an issue with the Perm Gen Memory.</p>

      <p class="p">Access the <span class="keyword wintitle">Perm Gen Memory History</span> sub-report by clicking on the
        bar.</p>

    </div>

    <div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Perm Gen Memory History Report</h2>

    <div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Overall Transfer Rate Chart</h2>
      
      
      <p class="p">The <span class="keyword wintitle">Overall Transfer Rate</span> chart displays the overall inbound/outbound
        transfer rates.</p>

      <p class="p">Overall Transfer Rate monitors the speed of inbound and outbound transfers in which files
        are currently being executed. This is an accumulation of all transfers currently being
        executed, and can be reduced by the trading partner(s) if their connectivity is lower than
        the maximum bandwidth of the VersaLex.</p>

      <p class="p">This can be used to see if the bandwidth is reaching a system maximum, at which time
        another VersaLex should be added to spread out the traffic.</p>

      <p class="p">Access the <span class="keyword wintitle">Overall Transfer Rate History</span> sub-report either by clicking
        on the bars or the bar label.</p>

    </div>

    </div>

    <div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Thread Count Chart</h2>
      
      
      <p class="p">The <span class="keyword wintitle">Thread Count</span> chart displays a count of the active and deadlocked
        threads. It also shows the peak number of threads since the last service restart.</p>

      <p class="p">Threads are similar to processes. Threads, like processes, are time-sliced by the kernel.
        On uniprocessor systems, the kernel uses time slicing to simulate simultaneous execution of
        threads in much the same way it uses time slicing with processes. On multiprocessor systems,
        threads are able to run simultaneously, just like two or more processes can.</p>

      <p class="p">This can be used to monitor the typical number of threads for their system. This will vary
        depending on the customer's outbound and inbound load. If the customer sees a significantly
        higher or lower number of threads during normal traffic, this could indicate an issue that
        something is not functioning correctly in the system.</p>
